The main objective of the module is to present the fundamental concepts of DevOps in a Linux environment. This will be achieved through an introduction to the discipline, supported by both theoretical and practical familiarization with some of the commonly used tools that form the foundation of most DevOps practices.

During the two courses within the module, topics such as virtualization, containerization, and the automation of core processes—such as provisioning, configuration, monitoring, and others—will be covered. Methods and tools for working in a team environment will be presented, including the creation, integration, and use of source code by more than one person simultaneously.

In addition, AI will be used to solve routine tasks that do not require active memorization, with the goal of freeing up resources for a deeper understanding and application of the new concepts.
